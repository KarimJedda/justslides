# justslides

Create a file called `slides.txt` with following contents:

```
% Title
% Author
% Date

slide 1

---

slide 2

---

then run `./generate.sh`. This will create a file called `output.html` with your presentation. An example is provided under `example/output.html`

Feel free to adapt the paths as you wish.

```

## Prerequisites

You need `pandoc` installed on your system. You can install pandoc by following the instructions [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

I've tested it with pandoc 3.1.8 on Ubuntu.
